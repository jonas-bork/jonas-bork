# About Me
I'm studying computer science, both in my university studies and in my free time.

I'm the co-owner of [Bork][bork-website], which is a Rocket League boosting platform.
For this, I have built a [website][bork-website] using C# and [ASP.NET][asp-net] and a Discord bot using C# and [Discord.Net][discord.net-rep]. For the Discord bot, I built the first (that I am aware of) PayPal integration, where people could, via a Discord GUI, select the order they would like to purchase and then be redirected to PayPal to complete the purchase. This allows for a fully automated ordering process inside of Discord.

In my free time, I am currently learning how to create apps with the [core/shell architecture][core-shell-arch]. Specifically, I have looked at creating a Rust core using [crux][crux-github] and then integrating this core into a frontend framework.
Additionally, I like to spend time on my [NixOS][nixos] configuration and learning how to package software using [Nix][nix-package-manager].
